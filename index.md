This is my math blog (I am still waiting for a better name), where i will write whatever comes to my mind.

I am currently a PhD student in ETH Zurich in algebraic geometry and the geometry of moduli spaces.

My interests lie between homological algebra, differential, complex an algebraic geometry.

I hope you enjoy it!!
